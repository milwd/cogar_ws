# This script subscribes to the preprocessed camera images and publishes
# the detected objects. The detection logic is currently a placeholder and
# should be replaced with actual object detection code. The script uses
# ROS to handle the camera data and publish the results. The script is
# designed to run as a ROS node and will keep running until it is interrupted.
# The script uses rospy to handle the ROS communication and threading.
# The script uses the Image message type from the sensor_msgs package to
# handle the camera data. The detected objects are published as a string
# message on the "/camera_detections" topic. The detection logic currently
# returns a placeholder string indicating the detected objects. The script
# is intended to be run in a ROS environment and requires the appropriate
# ROS setup and dependencies to be installed. The script can be extended
# to include actual object detection algorithms and integrate with other
# components of the robotic system.
